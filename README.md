# Concave Collision

---

## Introduction

This is a demonstration of how to achieve a concave collision path in UIKit Dynamics.
Because UIKit Dynamics does not permit concave paths, you can just create a series of
individual line collision paths (which collectively achieve concave performance).

This app will launch into a blank screen. 

 1. You can stroke a path by dragging you finger.
 2. You can drop a ball by tapping your finger.
 
So, here, I drew a curved path and then tapped above it to drop a ball.
